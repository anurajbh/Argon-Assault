# Argon-Assault
Welcome to Argon Assault, a game created for the Udemy course, "The Complete C# Unity Developer 3D(by Ben Tristem and Rick Davidson, GameDev.tv)". 

Argon Assault is an on-rails shooter, set in space. The player has to control their ship whilst traversing a mine on an astroid. The mine is being looted by pirates, and the player gains points by stopping their ships.

The project is currently nearing completion.
